What is OpenCompass ?

OpenCompass is a platform focused on understanding of the AGI, include Large Language Model and Multi-modality Model. We aim to:

- develop high-quality libraries to reduce the difficulties in evaluation
- provide convincing leaderboards for improving the understanding of the large models
- create powerful toolchains targeting a variety of abilities and tasks
- build solid benchmarks to support the large model research
- research on inference of Large Model(analysis, reasoning, prompt engineering.)
